The poasassignment module allows teachers to develop single task or variations of task, collect work from students, review it and provide feedback including multi-criterion grades. Module can distribute multiple task’s variants between students in different ways, using one of distribution strategies.

The module is based on old Assignment module, but it doesn’t use sources of old Assignment  - only idea. Poasassignment extends old Assignment by introducing variants (no more single task for dozens of students), criteria for grading and sub-plugin system. That means, that all submission types, all distribute strategies, are plugins, that can be modified separately from the core.
