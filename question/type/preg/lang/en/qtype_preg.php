<b>Native PHP preg matching engine</b> works using preg_match() function from PHP langugage (internally calling PCRE
library, which uses backtracking method). It supports full regular expression syntax, but don\'t allow
partial matches - so no hinting. Also, due to backtracking algorithm problems it could give wrong answers
on some regular expression like a?NaN (see http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html) - NFA engine are
best for this type of regexes. It\'s almost 100% debugged.<br/>
<b>DFA matching algorithm</b> support partial matching and could tell us shortest path to complete a match. However, it 
by nature can\'t support backreferences in regular expressions. It also doesn\'t handle well quantificators with
wide but finite limits like a{2,2000} - they generates too much edges on the DFA graph. DFA matching engine also
doesn\'t support submask extraction.';

Set this to Yes, if you write regular expressions for full student\'s answers. Setting this to No gives
you additional flexibility: you can specify some answer with low (or zero) grade to catch common errors and give
comments on them. You still can specify exact matches for some of you regular expressions if you start them with ^ and end with $.';
