<?php
/**
 * Contains source info for generation of lexer.
 *
 * If there are named subexpressions or backreferences, the returning nodes will contain not names but
 * their automatically-assigned numbers. To deal with names, the lexer saves a map name => number.
 *
 * As for error tokens, an error may be returned in 3 ways:
 *   a) as a regular node, but with non-null error field of it;
 *   b) as leafs, if it's not possible to act using the error field.
 *
 * The error field is usually filled if the node contains semantic errors but the syntax is correct:
 * for example, wrong quantifier borders {4,3}, wrong charset range z-a, etc.
 *
 * Additionally, all the errors found are also stored in the lexer's errors array and can be retrieved
 * by using the get_error_nodes() method.
 *
 * All nodes returned from the lexer should have valid userinscription and indexes.
