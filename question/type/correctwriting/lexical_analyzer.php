/**
 * Defines class of lexical analyzer for correct writing question.
 *
 * Lexical analyzer object is created for each correct answer and 
 * is responsible for tokenizing, looking for lexical mistakes (typos,
 * missing and extra separators etc) and other mistakes involving individual tokens,
 * merging resulting array of mistakes from all analyzers and determine 
 * answer fitness for the response.
 *
 * Lexical analyzers create and use sequence analyzers to determine structural mistakes.
 * There may be more than one sequence analyzer created if there are several equal groups of 
 * lexical mistakes possible.
