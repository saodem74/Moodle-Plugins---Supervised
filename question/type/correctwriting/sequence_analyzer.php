/**
 * Defines class of sequence analyzer for correct writing question.
 *
 * Sequence analyzer object is created for each possible set of lexical mistakes and 
 * is responsible for finding common parts of answer regarding sequence of tokens.
 * Longest common sequence algorithm is used to determine it.
 *
 * Sequence analyzers create and use syntax analyzers to determine structural mistakes using
 * language grammar. When using grammar analyzer is impossible, it determines sequence mistakes 
 * using lcs, i.e. misplaced, extra and missing tokens.
 * There may be more than one syntax analyzer created if there are several LCS'es of 
 * answer and response.
